# üåê Amrita - MUN2025 Website

A responsive and interactive website for Amrita - Model United Nations 2025 built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

üöÄ **Tech Stack**

* **Framework:** Next.js
* **Language:** TypeScript (TSX)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Animations:** Framer Motion

üì¶ **Getting Started**

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SudharsanSaravanan/mun2025.git](https://github.com/SudharsanSaravanan/mun2025.git)
    cd mun2025
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    This project uses `npm` for package management. Run the following commands in the project directory to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install react-tilt framer-motion --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

    * `npm install`: Installs the core dependencies required for the Next.js project, including React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
    * `npm install react-tilt framer-motion --legacy-peer-deps`: Installs the `react-tilt` library for interactive tilt effects and `framer-motion` for animations. The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is included to handle potential peer dependency conflicts that might arise with older versions of these libraries.

3.  **Run the Development Server**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the development server, and you can view the website in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
